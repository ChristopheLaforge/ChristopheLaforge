- 👋 Hi, I’m Christophe.
- 👀 I’m interested in statistical physics, deep learning, and quantitative finance.
- 📚 Currently, I’m exploring self-avoiding random walks—a truly fascinating topic.
- 🤔 Like many, I find agentic AI puzzling and am working to develop an objective perspective on it.
- 💡 I’m also curious about quantum computing, particularly in the context of quantum algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m eager to exchange ideas! As a casual coder, I’d greatly appreciate any Python tips or advice.
- 📫 How to reach me: laforge4104 at gmail.com
