- 👋 Hi, I’m Christophe
- 👀 I’m interested in statistical physics, deep learning and quantitative finance
- 👀 I'm currently reading a lot about self-avoiding random walks. It is a truly fascinating topic
- 👀 I'm also very curious about quantum computing (in the limit scope of quantum algorithmic) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning artificial intelligence for finance at AIFI
- 💞️ I’m looking to exchange ideas. I'm a casual coder so I welcome any good Python advices.
